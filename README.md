# PAGviz
PAGviz is a simple command-line interface for displaying Partial Ancestral Graphs (PAGs), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) or Complete Partial DAGs (CPDAGs) exported in a text format from the [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) program for causal discovery.

It can output the graph either as an image (`.png` by default) generated by the [pydot](https://github.com/pydot/pydot) Python package, or a `.dot` file that can be edited and displayed separately using any Graphviz-compatible software. The image can also be sent to `stdout` as an option (tested on a Linux machine).

## Usage
```
PAGviz [-h] [-w] [-f FILE_OUTPUT] [-t] input_file

Simple command to convert a PAG (Partial Ancestral Graph) in a TXT format exported from Tetrad into a DOT format with a color scheme for the different edge types, and output as an image
or DOT file.

positional arguments:
  input_file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w, --white-background
                        Add a white background to the graph instead of OldLace

output:
  Choose one or more output modes

  -f, --file-output FILE_OUTPUT
                        A path with a filename (with the extension) to save the output to a desired location. If the extension is `.dot`, a DOT file is produced instead of an image.
                        Example: './output_pag.png' or '../dot_files/output_pag.dot'
  -t, --terminal-output
                        Output the result to stdout in the PNG format.
